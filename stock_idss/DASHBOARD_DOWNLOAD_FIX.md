# Dashboard Download Fix

## Problem
When users clicked the download buttons in the enhanced dashboard, the page would reset and all analysis results would be lost. This happened because Streamlit reruns the entire script when a download button is clicked.

## Solution
Implemented session state persistence to store analysis results across page reruns.

### Key Changes

1. **Session State Storage**: Analysis results are now stored in `st.session_state['analysis_results']` after completion
2. **Separated Display Logic**: Download buttons are moved outside the analysis function
3. **Persistent Results**: Results remain available even after downloads
4. **Clear Results Option**: Added a button to manually clear stored results

### How It Works

1. **Analysis Phase**: When "Run Analysis" is clicked, results are stored in session state
2. **Display Phase**: Results are displayed from session state, not from the analysis function
3. **Download Phase**: Download buttons work without triggering a full page reset
4. **Persistence**: Results remain available until manually cleared or page is refreshed

### Files Modified

- `stock_idss/app/enhanced_dashboard.py`: Main dashboard with session state implementation
- `stock_idss/src/enhanced_features.py`: Fixed to include price data columns for visualization
- `stock_idss/test_session_persistence.py`: Test script to verify the fix

### Benefits

✅ **No More Page Resets**: Downloads don't cause analysis results to disappear  
✅ **Better UX**: Users can download multiple files without re-running analysis  
✅ **Data Persistence**: Results stay available for further exploration  
✅ **Clear Controls**: Easy way to clear results when needed  

### Usage

1. Run analysis as normal
2. Results are automatically stored in session state
3. Use download buttons - results remain visible
4. Use "Clear Results" button to reset when done

### Testing

Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
python stock_idss/test_session_persistence.py
```

This ensures that:
- Session state can store analysis results
- Data can be serialized for downloads
- CSV files are generated correctly
- Data integrity is maintained
